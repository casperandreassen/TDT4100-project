## Starting the application 

Make sure to enter the project directory for file reading/writing to work correctly.  

```sh
cd TDT4100-PROJECT 
```

Make sure that Java-FX verison is currect for your system in `billing/pom.xml`. For Mac's with M1 chipset you need `18-ea+6` for the application to run correctly.


Run MainApp in  `billing/src/main/java/billing_app/MainApp.java`
